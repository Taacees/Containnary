### Target
User Data is the TOP periority (include data change history):
1. Let TW5 work on Node.js with the "Generate Single HTML file" for each changes (like what TiddlyDesktop do)
2. Let TW5 single HTML file be served in DAV server with "Generate Single HTML file for each changes)
3. Separate the "resources" (Images, attachment, PDF, Docs, .....) from the TW5, using separated "WebServer" (access resource as http://links inside Tiddlers)

### HWY?

1. HTML is organically served as http://links (local file links are just "mutation")
2. We face situation where Browsers (or Browser plugins) trade local file diffrently (didn't work as expected or as if the same HTML is servered by HTTP server)
